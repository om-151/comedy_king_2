            <p>Comedy has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years, evolving
                alongside changes in technology
                and societal norms. Today, the digital landscape provides a vast canvas for comedians, YouTubers, and
                content creators to experiment with various comedic styles. From short skits to elaborate sketches, the
                possibilities are endless. In the age of memes and short attention spans, micro-comedy has become a
                dominant force. Snappy, bite-sized humor in the form of memes, GIFs, and short video clips often spreads
                like wildfire across social media. These quick hits of comedy provide instant gratification and serve as
                a digital antidote to the stresses of everyday life. </p>
